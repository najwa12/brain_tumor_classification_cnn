# AI-Powered Brain Tumor Classification With Noisy Data: Advanced MRI Analysis with CNNs

This repository was forked from an earlier project that trained a classifier on the **Brain Tumor Classification (MRI) Dataset** created by **sartajbhuvaji**, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri). Building on that foundation, this fork expands the work by:

- Augmenting the existing dataset with an **additional brain MRI dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset), which contains the same tumor categories.  
- **Adding artificial noise** to the new dataset before augmentation, making the model robust to both noisy and clean MRI data.

The original authors of this project used **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning (TL)** to explore how modern AI techniques can support medical diagnosis and improve patient care. Their approach is based on **EfficientNetB0**, a state-of-the-art model pre-trained on the **ImageNet** dataset. The original authors fine-tuned the model specifically for brain tumor classification.

The purpose of this expansion is to train a classifier that better reflects **real-world MRI conditions**, where images are often noisy and preprocessing can be costly in terms of time and resources. The model will be **re-trained on the combined dataset** and evaluated using the same metrics, while **tuning hyperparameters** for optimal performance.

## Relevance

Brain tumors represent a critical medical challenge due to their complex nature and the difficulty in accurate, early detection. Key challenges include:
- **Complex Tumor Characteristics**: Tumor sizes, shapes, and locations vary widely across patients, making it hard for traditional diagnostic methods to consistently deliver accurate results.
- **Time-Intensive Diagnosis**: Manual review of MRI scans by radiologists is slow, prone to human error, and highly dependent on expertise.
- **Access to Skilled Radiologists**: In many regions, there is limited access to healthcare professionals skilled in interpreting medical imaging, delaying diagnoses and treatments.
- **Noisy Imaging**: MRI scans may contain noise or blurriness due to patient movement, resulting in unclear MRI scans that are difficult to review.

The expansion of this project will focus on addressing the last key challenge, through classifying brain tumors in noisy brain MRI images.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this expansion include:
- **Brain Tumor Classification**: Using deep learning techniques, the model will classify brain tumors into four categories: Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor.
- **Improving Diagnostic Accuracy With Noisy Images**: By augmenting the dataset with artificially noisy MRI scans, the model is trained to recognize tumors even in imperfect conditions, improving robustness and real-world applicability.
- **Dataset Expansion and Diversity**: Incorporate a second publicly available brain MRI dataset to increase the size, variety, and representativeness of training data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Re-train and fine-tune the model with the expanded dataset, adjusting learning rate, dropout, batch size, and other hyperparameters to optimize accuracy.
- **Generalization and Reliability**: Evaluate model performance across both noisy and clean datasets to ensure consistent diagnostic capability.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project consist of labeled MRI images for brain tumor detection and classification. The data is sourced from reputable open-source contributions:
- [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427)
- [SARTAJ dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)
- [Br35H](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection?select=no)

These datasets are well-suited for training deep learning models, containing multiple categories of brain tumor images along with non-tumor images.

## Model Architecture

The model is currently built upon **EfficientNetB0**, a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) known for its efficiency and performance. The original authors utilized **Transfer Learning (TL)** to fine-tune the pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model on the brain tumor dataset, allowing them to leverage features learned from the ImageNet dataset and apply them to the specialized task of brain tumor classification. The architecture includes:

1. **EfficientNetB0 Backbone**:
   - **Pretrained on ImageNet**: The pre-trained weights from ImageNet are used to benefit from powerful feature extraction capabilities.
   - **No Fully Connected Layers**: The fully connected layers are excluded to allow flexibility in model output based on the specific task (image classification).
  
2. **Global Average Pooling**:
   - This layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, converting them into a single vector, which is easier to classify and prevents overfitting.

3. **Dropout Layer**:
   - To improve generalization and avoid overfitting, a dropout layer is added with a 50% dropout rate.

4. **Dense Layer with Softmax Activation**:
   - The final output layer uses softmax activation to classify the input into one of four classes: Glioma Tumor, No Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, and Pituitary Tumor.

5. **Optimizer and Loss Function**:
   - **Adam optimizer** is used for efficient weight updates.
   - The loss function is **categorical crossentropy**, suitable for multi-class classification.

## Techniques and Methodology

### 1. **Transfer Learning (TL)**
   - **Transfer Learning** allows leveraging pre-trained models on large datasets like ImageNet, significantly reducing training time and improving accuracy, even with smaller datasets.
   - This project uses **EfficientNetB0**, a highly optimized CNN model pre-trained on ImageNet.
   - The pre-trained weights are loaded (`weights='imagenet'`) and the final output layer is excluded (`include_top=False`) to tailor the model for brain tumor classification.
   - Custom layers are added:
     - **GlobalAveragePooling2D**: Reduces dimensionality while retaining important features.
     - **Dropout**: Prevents overfitting by omitting neurons during training.
     - **Dense Layer**: Final output layer with Softmax activation to classify images into tumor categories (glioma, no tumor, meningioma, pituitary).
