# üß† AI-Powered Brain Tumor Classification: Advanced MRI Analysis with CNNs

This project uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** to accurately classify brain tumors from MRI scans. By employing **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning (TL)**, we aim to tackle challenges in medical diagnostics and provide an automated, scalable solution for healthcare professionals worldwide.

## ü©∫ Why It Matters

Brain tumors represent a critical medical challenge due to their complex nature and the difficulty in accurate, early detection. Key challenges include:
- üîç **Complex Tumor Characteristics**: Tumor sizes, shapes, and locations vary widely across patients, making it hard for traditional diagnostic methods to consistently deliver accurate results.
- ‚è≥ **Time-Intensive Diagnosis**: Manual review of MRI scans by radiologists is slow, prone to human error, and highly dependent on expertise.
- üåç **Access to Skilled Radiologists**: In many regions, there is limited access to healthcare professionals skilled in interpreting medical imaging, delaying diagnoses and treatments.

This project offers a **fast**, **reliable**, and **automated** solution for detecting and classifying brain tumors, thereby assisting medical professionals in reducing diagnostic time and errors.

## üéØ Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:
- üìä **Brain Tumor Classification**: Using deep learning techniques, we classify brain tumors into four categories: Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor.
- üåê **Scalable Diagnostic Framework**: Developing a framework for deploying the model as a cloud-based diagnostic tool to enable worldwide use.
- ‚ö° **Optimized Diagnostic Accuracy**: By leveraging **Transfer Learning**, we improve the model‚Äôs performance even with relatively small datasets.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled MRI images for brain tumor detection and classification. The data is sourced from reputable open-source contributions by:
- **Navoneel Chakrabarty**  
- **Swati Kanchan**

The dataset is well-suited for training deep learning models, containing multiple categories of brain tumor images along with non-tumor images.

## üß† Model Architecture

The model is built upon **EfficientNetB0**, a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) known for its efficiency and performance. We utilize **Transfer Learning (TL)** to fine-tune the pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model on our brain tumor dataset, allowing us to leverage features learned from the ImageNet dataset and apply them to the specialized task of brain tumor classification. The architecture includes:

1. **EfficientNetB0 Backbone**:
   - **Pretrained on ImageNet**: We start by using the pre-trained weights from ImageNet to benefit from powerful feature extraction capabilities.
   - **No Fully Connected Layers**: The fully connected layers are excluded to allow flexibility in model output based on our specific task (image classification).
  
2. **Global Average Pooling**:
   - This layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, converting them into a single vector, which is easier to classify and prevents overfitting.

3. **Dropout Layer**:
   - To improve generalization and avoid overfitting, a dropout layer is added with a 50% dropout rate.

4. **Dense Layer with Softmax Activation**:
   - The final output layer uses softmax activation to classify the input into one of four classes: Glioma Tumor, No Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, and Pituitary Tumor.

5. **Optimizer and Loss Function**:
   - **Adam optimizer** is used for efficient weight updates.
   - The loss function is **categorical crossentropy**, suitable for multi-class classification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques and Methodology

### 1. **Transfer Learning (TL)**
   - Transfer learning is a key technique that allows the model to leverage pre-trained knowledge from large datasets (like ImageNet) and fine-tune it for our specific task. This significantly reduces the time needed for training and improves accuracy, even when working with smaller datasets.
   - We used **EfficientNetB0**, a highly optimized CNN model known for balancing computational efficiency and accuracy.

### 2. **Data Augmentation**
   - To artificially increase the size of the training dataset, we applied data augmentation techniques, including rotations, flips, zooms, and translations. This helps the model generalize better and reduces overfitting.

### 3. **Model Optimization**
   - To improve performance, **learning rate reduction** and **early stopping** were used to adjust the model's learning rate and prevent overfitting, allowing the model to converge more efficiently.
   - We used **TensorBoard** for monitoring training progress, providing insights into accuracy and loss metrics over time.

### 4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Various hyperparameters were fine-tuned, including the **dropout rate**, **learning rate**, and **batch size** to ensure the model achieved optimal results.

## üìä Results and Performance

The model achieved **high accuracy** and consistent performance across all classes. Here are some of the key metrics:

### **Model Performance Metrics:**

- **Overall Accuracy**: 98% on the test dataset, showcasing the model's ability to correctly classify the majority of test cases.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Each class (Glioma Tumor, No Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Pituitary Tumor) performed well, with the model achieving F1-scores near 1.00 for most categories.
  
#### **Confusion Matrix**:
- The confusion matrix shows that the model can reliably differentiate between the four classes, with minimal misclassification between tumor types.

### **Training & Validation Accuracy**:
- The model was trained for **12 epochs**. During training, the validation accuracy steadily improved, reaching up to **99.23%** by the final epoch.

### **Example Outputs**:
- For **Class 0 (Glioma Tumor)**, the model had a precision of **0.99** and recall of **0.97**, indicating high accuracy in identifying glioma tumors.
- For **Class 1 (No Tumor)**, the model had a perfect precision and recall of **1.00**, reflecting its reliability in identifying images with no tumor.
