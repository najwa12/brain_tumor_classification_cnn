# 🧠 AI-Powered Brain Tumor Classification: Advanced MRI Analysis with CNNs  

This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Deep Learning** to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans. By using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning (TL)**, we tackle the challenges of accurate diagnosis and offer a scalable, automated solution to assist healthcare professionals worldwide.  

## 🩺 Why It Matters  
Brain tumors are one of the most aggressive diseases affecting both children and adults, with significant diagnostic challenges:  
- 🔍 **Complexity**: Tumor sizes, shapes, and locations vary significantly.  
- ⏳ **Time-Intensive**: Manual MRI analysis is slow and prone to errors.  
- 🌍 **Global Access**: Limited availability of skilled radiologists in developing regions.  

This project addresses these issues by providing an AI-powered system for fast, reliable, and accurate brain tumor classification.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- 📊 Classify brain tumors into four categories using **Deep Learning** techniques.  
- 🌐 Create a framework for a cloud-based diagnostic tool.  
- ⚡ Optimize diagnostic accuracy with Transfer Learning.  

## 📁 Dataset  
The MRI dataset used in this project is curated from open-source contributions by:  
- **Navoneel Chakrabarty**  
- **Swati Kanchan**  

## 🛠️ Key Features  
- 🤖 **Deep Learning Models**: Powered by CNNs and TL.  
- ⚙️ **Automation**: Scalable and efficient diagnostic system.  
- 📈 **High Accuracy**: Optimized for small datasets using Transfer Learning techniques.
