        "# AI-Powered Brain Tumor Classification: Advanced MRI Analysis with CNNs\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Deep Learning** can revolutionize the detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI images. Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning (TL)**, we aim to tackle the complexities of brain tumor diagnosis with a highly accurate and automated approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Context\n",
        "Brain tumors are among the most aggressive and complex diseases, presenting significant challenges in diagnosis due to variations in size, shape, and location. Manual examination of MRI scans is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, especially in regions with limited access to skilled radiologists and neurosurgeons. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI techniques, this notebook seeks to overcome these challenges, providing a scalable and efficient solution for medical professionals worldwide.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "- **Detect and classify brain tumors** into four distinct classes using CNNs and Transfer Learning.\n",
        "- **Address the diagnostic challenges** posed by tumor variability and resource constraints.\n",
        "- **Provide the foundation** for a cloud-based automated diagnostic system to support healthcare practitioners.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Highlights\n",
        "- **Dataset**: A curated MRI dataset for brain tumor classification, acknowledging contributions from Navoneel Chakrabarty and Swati Kanchan.\n",
        "- **Techniques Used**: Deep Learning methods, including CNNs and Transfer Learning, to optimize classification accuracy.\n",
        "- **Goal**: Build a robust and reliable AI model that enhances diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.\n",
